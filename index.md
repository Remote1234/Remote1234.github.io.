### CPSC 120

* Lab 5 

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite because I thought it was cool on how we are printing
    a sandwich order. We used strings and arguments to create this. It was great because we can put any protein, bread, and condiment on it.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was another favorite because I like how we are able to make patterns. We
    We used inner and outer loops to create this. We also learned how to put a loop inside another loop.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because we were able to create blackjack which is my favorite card game. I like how I was able to make functions that would make the card you had be the right amount of points. For example a king,queen,jack all equal 10 points.
